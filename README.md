# DoParser

A parser written in Python (WIP)

Current version: 0.1.0

## Installation

Install Python3 if it isn't installed already, then symlink `parser.py` to some `doparser`.

That's it.

## Using

Don't even think about it, it isn't even remotly ready.

## Contributing

You can always contribute using Pull requests, or, if you contact me under dodo2998@gmail.com, by being added to the contributers.

As the last option requires a lot of trust, you may get (kindly) reminded to use pull requests for now.

Please always change the version number in this file accordingly: Add one to the last digit.
If you build new features, this will have to go on a different branch, with a `+0` after the version. (Indicating a new feature, that hasn't been added to the main branch yet)

Also: Thanks for contributing!
